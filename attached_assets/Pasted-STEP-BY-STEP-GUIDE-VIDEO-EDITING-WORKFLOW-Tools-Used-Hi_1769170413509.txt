STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE: VIDEO EDITING WORKFLOW
Tools Used
Higgs Field – Generate AI video scenes and voice-over
ElevenLabs – Voice Generation (2nd option)
transitionalhooks.com – Generate high-engagement hooks
CapCut – Edit and finalize the video

Step 1: Define the Video Goal
Before using any tool:
Decide the platform (Reels, TikTok, Shorts)
Confirm video length (e.g., 15-20 seconds)
Identify the purpose (educational, explainer)
Decide tone (professional, casual, energetic)

Step 2: Generate the Hook (transitionalhooks.com) 
Go to transitionalhooks.com
Select a hook style that is engaging and attention-grabbing
Choose a hook that runs between 5 and 10 seconds
✅ This hook will be used as:
Used at the start of the video to engage viewers right away. 
Placed at the video’s opening to hook viewers instantly. 
Step 3: Create Script using ChatGPT 
Open ChatGPT 
Generate a 2–3-line education-focused testimonial on MEDICAID.
Key phrase: “For less than a dollar a day”
Keyword: “Protection”
Save it in a Word/Notepad file for later editing
Sample
“I work hard just to stay afloat, and Medicaid paperwork felt overwhelming. Freeman Filing helps simplify the process and keep me organized, for less than a dollar a day. Stay protected when it matters most.”

Generate Audio:













Enter the script previously generated in ChatGPT.
Choose a voice that best matches the description of the image.
Then Generate.
Note: The script should be 10–20 seconds long. If it exceeds 20 seconds, rephrase it using ChatGPT. Split it into two parts since each video segment can only be 10 seconds. 

Prompt:
      (It tells the AI what scenes, actions, or visuals to create in the video.) 
Sample Prompt:
An elderly man with a solemn expression sits at a worn wooden table in a dim, aged kitchen. He folds his hands on the table, then slowly glances out the window where the faint view of a quiet street is visible. He takes a deep breath and exhales quietly, lost in thought. The camera starts with a tight close-up on his face, capturing his contemplative eyes, then slowly pulls back and pans to reveal the peeling walls, cracked paint, and worn furniture surrounding him, emphasizing the sense of time and memory in the room. The audio features soft, ambient creaks of an old house, subtle street sounds outside, and the faint rustle of the curtain in the breeze, enhancing the quiet, reflective atmosphere.

Check proper framing and safe margin
Ensure smooth, natural transitions between clips and hooks.
Confirm branding consistency
